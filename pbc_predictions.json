  "paper_methods_blurb": "To demonstrate prospective utility beyond retrospective validation, we applied the algorithm to 1 diseases not included in the validation set. For each disease, we report the top-ranked candidates with mechanistic rationale and supporting gene-pathway evidence (Table X). Novelty was assessed as the PubMed co-occurrence literature score: scores < 0.05 indicate few published reports (HIGH novelty). These predictions represent testable hypotheses and are not clinical recommendations."
